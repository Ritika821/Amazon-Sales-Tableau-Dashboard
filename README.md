## Conclusion :

From this report, I found that Amazon Company wass not at the adequate operating margin as its overall profit percent was just almost 11%. As we can see from the above insights that in many countries Company has suffered from losses. To recover from this situation Company should focus on the customer behaviour, their requirements and should improve its service facilities in order to get better feedback otherwise company will might be passed out by its competitors if it will loses the opportunity. This report and dashboard is helpful for gaining knowledge about the circumstances of the Amazon Company and to do comparison between its various categories, regions and countries, to know in which Country Amazon is highly popular and in which region it was suffering from loss and we can derive other meaningful information according to our requirement from this report.
